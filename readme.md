# Ambulate API

*Back-end* remake of my Master's final thesis for the Geoinformation & Geoapps development master.

## Description

Briefly, Ambulate is a mobile app that's capable of both registering and georeferencing the routes that users travel and of showing the user a form about how the space where it is located makes it feel. The Ambulate API is built with Node.js and allows to send and retrieve user data like the geometries of the routes walked, the answers on forms, the calculation of the total distance travelled by the user, and more.

*Still in development*
